```

## Question 4: Longest trip

What is the length of the longest trip in the dataset in hours?

- 122
- 142
- 162
- 182

> Query

```sql

FROM yellow_2024_10;
```

> Answer

```
162
```

## Question 5: User Interface

Sparkâ€™s User Interface which shows the application's dashboard runs on which local port?

- Governor's Island/Ellis Island/Liberty Island
- Arden Heights
- Rikers Island
- Jamaica Bay

> Query

```sql
SELECT 
zones.Zone AS pickup_location_zone, 
COUNT(1)
FROM yellow_2024_10 yellow 
LEFT JOIN zones 
ON yellow.PULocationID = zones.LocationID
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 ASC;
```

> Answer

```
Governor's Island/Ellis Island/Liberty Island
